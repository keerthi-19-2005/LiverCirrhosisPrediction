ðŸ”¹ Activity 1: Specify the Diabetes Results

Objective:
	Explore the influence of diabetic factors on liver cirrhosis and identify relevant features in the dataset that reflect this connection.

Work Done:

	Researched clinical studies that show the correlation between diabetes and liver damage.

	Identified key diabetic indicators such as blood sugar, glucose levels, insulin resistance, and their impact on the liver.

	Mapped these indicators to relevant columns in the chosen liver dataset for better prediction.

Outcome:

	Validated the inclusion of diabetes-related attributes for improved model accuracy.

	Highlighted the multi-system nature of cirrhosis for comprehensive prediction modeling.
