**Activity 2: System Overview and Predictive Workflow Documentation**

**Objective:**
	Document the end-to-end process of building and deploying a liver cirrhosis prediction model using machine learning.

**Work Done:**

	Developed an overview of the pipeline:

		Dataset acquisition → Preprocessing → EDA → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Evaluation → Deployment

	Considered real-world deployment needs like:

		Integration with healthcare systems.

		Real-time prediction.

		Data privacy and interpretability.

**Covered Topics:**

	Introduction to ML in healthcare.

	Dataset cleaning and preparation.

	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding key patterns.

	Feature engineering and handling imbalanced data.

	Model selection: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting.

	Evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC Curve.

	Interpretability using SHAP, feature importance plots.

	Clinical deployment and limitations.

**Outcome:**

	A well-structured documentation of system architecture and design.
